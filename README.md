# [uScroll] v1.0.0

A javascript plugin that show you a custum scrollbar in different position.

Demo available here : https://viclafouch.github.io/uscroll/demo.html

## Usage

jQuery __is not necessary__ for this library. 
Include the uScroll's script and stylesheet to your page :

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/uscroll.min.css" />
<script src=js/uscroll.min.js"></script>
```

Then, bind any element with a title attribute :

```js
uScroll.bind('position', 'customBackground', showScrollbar?);
```

## 3 Options
* __position__:  Specifie the scrollbar's position. Default : `right`
* __customBackground__: Add a beautiful gradient color to the scrollbar. Default: `null`
* __showScrollbar__: Show the original scrollbar. Default: `false`

## Custom CSS class available

The uscrollbar is a `<div>` element with the class name `uscroll__custom`. Its default styles appear first in the document and can be overridden by rules that come later.

__Note:__ : You need to set the __customBackground__ option to `null` (Default value) or empty.

For example, the following code will result in a green uscrollbar:

```js
uScroll.bind();
```

```css
.uscroll__custom {
  background-color: green;
}
```

## Backgrounds available

* orange
* blue
* pink

## Exemple 

```js
uScroll.bind('top', 'blue', 'true');
```

```js
uScroll.bind('bottom');
```
